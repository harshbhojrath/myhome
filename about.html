        <h1>What are the principles of interior design?
        </h1>
        <p>
            The principles of interior design are the rules and guidelines that designers follow to create functional, aesthetically pleasing spaces. There are seven main principles of interior design: balance, harmony, rhythm, proportion and scale, emphasis, contrast, and details. These concepts can be applied to any room in your home, from the living room to the bathroom.

        <h1>
            1. Balance

        </h1>
        <p>
            In design, balance gives the impression of equilibrium. It refers to a visual aspect, and it is about distributing furniture and decorative objects as evenly as possible so that things have the same visual weight when looking at a room. To achieve balance, it is important to pay attention to where the elements are placed within the space. For this, we must carefully analyze the line, shape, color, and texture of the different objects.

            There are three types of balance: formal, informal, and radial.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Symmetrical or formal
        </h1>
        <p>
            Traditional or formal rooms require symmetrical balance, which is the art of mirroring and matching each side of a room. For example, two chairs on either side of a coffee table may be described as symmetrically balanced. This type of balance is simple to achieve since design features are duplicated on both sides. This technique is also known as the mirror effect. If you’re not careful, formal balance might quickly become boring and repetitive.
